## SAS Viya File Transfer CLI

The viya-file-UD-er is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application written in Go, designed to upload and download files between a local system and SAS Viya, supporting both SAS Content (Viyaâ€™s internal folder structure) and Shared Drive (physical file system). The application can be run interactively or as batch using parameters. Important functionalities are noted below:
1. The application is a single binary. It contains all dependencies and so it can be run without requiring a runtime environment. In other words, all you need is your command prompt/terminal to run the application.
2. Upload or Download one or more file from local or shared drive to SAS Content or Shared Drive in SAS Viya.
3. When uploading file(s) users can choose to upload *.zip, *.tar, and *.tar.gz files and upload them as is OR they can choose to unzip and upload.
4. Similarly, when downloading files users can download files as is, or they can choose to zip all files and download a single *.zip file.

## Running the Application
**Run Modes**

<pre><code>```bash```
```./viya-file-UD-er upload```
```./viya-file-UD-er download ```</code></pre>
